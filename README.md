Introduction:
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. It is often used as a beginner's dataset for practicing classification techniques, data visualization, and other statistical analyses. The dataset contains samples of iris flowers, with features describing various aspects of the flowers, such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Each sample is labeled with the species of iris it belongs to, making it a supervised learning problem.

Dataset Overview:

Number of Instances: 150
Number of Attributes: 4 numeric, predictive attributes, and the class
Attribute Information:
Sepal length in cm
Sepal width in cm
Petal length in cm
Petal width in cm
Class:
Iris Setosa
Iris Versicolour
